# OAuth2 Resource Server

This is a spring REST application, but without `security` module. I am here trying to implement an OAuth2 Resource Server from scratch. I created this to study OAuth2 Resource Server mechanism. I hope, I have included all important steps in here. I will try to update the repository if I get any more information or suggestions.

### Note:
I am using `Keycloak` as OAuth2 Server
